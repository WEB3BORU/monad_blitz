# GoldRush SDK for TypeScript

The GoldRush SDK is the fastest way to integrate the GoldRush API for working with blockchain data. The SDK works with all [supported chains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/) including Mainnets and Testnets.

> Use with [`NodeJS v18`](https://nodejs.org/en) or above for best results.

> The GoldRush API is required. You can register for a free key on [GoldRush's website](https://goldrush.dev/platform/apikey)

## Using the SDK

> You can also follow the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSpPJP2w62E&ab_channel=Covalent)

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install @covalenthq/client-sdk
   ```

2. Create a client using the `GoldRushClient`

   ```ts
   import { GoldRushClient, Chains } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

   const client = new GoldRushClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");

   const ApiServices = async () => {
     try {
       const balanceResp =
         await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(
           "eth-mainnet",
           "0xfc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de"
         );

       if (balanceResp.error) {
         throw balanceResp;
       }

       console.log(balanceResp.data);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     }
   };
   ```

   The `GoldRushClient` can be configured with a second object argument, `settings`, and a third argument for `streamingConfig`. The settings offered are

   1. **debug**: A boolean that enables server logs of the API calls, enhanced with the request URL, response time and code, and other settings. It is set as `false` by default.
   2. **threadCount**: A number that sets the number of concurrent requests allowed. It is set as `2` by default.
   3. **enableRetry**: A boolean that enables retrying the API endpoint in case of a `429 - rate limit` error. It is set as `true` by default.
   4. **maxRetries**: A number that sets the number of retries to be made in case of `429 - rate limit` error. To be in effect, it requires `enableRetry` to be enabled. It is set as `2` by default.
   5. **retryDelay**: A number that sets the delay in `ms` for retrying the API endpoint in case of `429 - rate limit` error. To be in effect, it requires `enableRetry` to be enabled. It is set as `2` by default.
   6. **source**: A string that defines the `source` of the request of better analytics.

   The `streamingConfig` is optional and configures the real-time streaming service. The available options are:

   1. **shouldRetry**: A function that determines whether to retry connection based on retry count. Defaults to retry up to 5 times.
   2. **maxReconnectAttempts**: Maximum number of reconnection attempts. Defaults to `5`.
   3. **onConnecting**: Callback function triggered when connecting to the streaming service.
   4. **onOpened**: Callback function triggered when connection is successfully established.
   5. **onClosed**: Callback function triggered when connection is closed.
   6. **onError**: Callback function triggered when an error occurs.

## Features

### 1. Name Resolution

The GoldRush SDK natively resolves the underlying wallet address for the following

1. ENS Domains (e.g. `demo.eth`)
2. Lens Handles (e.g. `demo.lens`)
3. Unstoppable Domains (e.g. `demo.x`)
4. RNS Domains (e.g. `demo.ron`)

### 2. Query Parameters

All the API call arguments have an option to pass `typed objects` as Query parameters.

For example, the following sets the `quoteCurrency` query parameter to `CAD` and the parameter `nft` to `true` for fetching all the token balances, including NFTs, for a wallet address:

```ts
const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(
  "eth-mainnet",
  "0xfc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de",
  {
    quoteCurrency: "CAD",
    nft: true,
  }
);
```

### 3. Exported Types

All the `interface`s used, for arguments, query parameters and responses are also exported from the package which can be used for custom usage.

For example, explicitly typecasting the response

```ts
import {
  GoldRushClient,
  type BalancesResponse,
  type BalanceItem,
} from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(
  "eth-mainnet",
  "0xfc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de",
  {
    quoteCurrency: "CAD",
    nft: true,
  }
);

const data: BalancesResponse = resp.data;
const items: BalanceItem[] = resp.data.items;
```

### 4. Multiple Chain input formats

The SDK supports the following formats for the chain input:

1. Chain Name (e.g. `eth-mainnet`)
2. Chain ID (e.g. `1`)
3. Chain Name Enum (e.g. `ChainName.ETH_MAINNET`)
4. Chain ID Enum (e.g. `ChainID.ETH_MAINNET`)

### 5. Additional Non-Paginated methods

For paginated responses, the GoldRush API can at max support 100 items per page. However, the Covalent SDK leverages generators to _seamlessly fetch all items without the user having to deal with pagination_.

For example, the following fetches ALL transactions for `0xfc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de` on Ethereum:

```ts
import { GoldRushClient } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const ApiServices = async () => {
  const client = new GoldRushClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");
  try {
    for await (const tx of client.TransactionService.getAllTransactionsForAddress(
      "eth-mainnet",
      "0xfc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de"
    )) {
      console.log("tx", tx);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
};
```

### 6. Executable pagination functions

Paginated methods have been enhanced with the introduction of `next()` and `prev()` support functions. These functions facilitate a smoother transition for developers navigating through our `links` object, which includes `prev` and `next` fields. Instead of requiring developers to manually extract values from these fields and create JavaScript API fetch calls for the URL values, the new `next()` and `prev()` functions provide a streamlined approach, allowing developers to simulate this behavior more efficiently.

```ts
import { GoldRushClient } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const client = new GoldRushClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");
const resp = await client.TransactionService.getAllTransactionsForAddressByPage(
  "eth-mainnet",
  "0xfc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de"
); // assuming resp.data.current_page is 10
if (resp.data !== null) {
  const prevPage = await resp.data.prev(); // will retrieve page 9
  console.log(prevPage.data);
}
```

### 7. Utility Functions

1. **bigIntParser**: Formats input as a `bigint` value. For example

   ```ts
   bigIntParser("-123"); // -123n
   ```

   You can explore more examples [here](./test/unit/bigint-parser.test.ts)

2. **calculatePrettyBalance**: Formats large and raw numbers and bigints to human friendly format. For example

   ```ts
   calculatePrettyBalance(1.5, 3, true, 4); // "0.0015"
   ```

   You can explore more examples [here](./test/unit/calculate-pretty-balance.test.ts)

3. **isValidApiKey**: Checks for the input as a valid GoldRush API Key. For example

   ```ts
   isValidApiKey(cqt_wF123); // false
   ```

   You can explore more examples [here](./test/unit/is-valid-api-key.test.ts)

4. **prettifyCurrency**: Formats large and raw numbers and bigints to human friendly currency format. For example

   ```ts
   prettifyCurrency(89.0, 2, "CAD"); // "CA$89.00"
   ```

   You can explore more examples [here](./test/unit/is-valid-api-key.test.ts)

5. **timestampParser**: Convert ISO timestamps to various human-readable formats

   ```ts
   timestampParser("2024-10-16T12:39:23.000Z", "descriptive"); // "October 16 2024 at 18:09:23"
   ```

   You can explore more examples [here](./test/unit/timestamp-parser.test.ts)

### 8. Real-time Streaming

The GoldRush SDK now supports real-time streaming of blockchain data via WebSocket connections. This allows you to subscribe to live data feeds for OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for trading pairs and tokens, new DEX pair creations, wallet activity, and more.

```ts
import {
  GoldRushClient,
  StreamingChain,
  StreamingInterval,
  StreamingTimeframe,
  StreamingProtocol,
} from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const client = new GoldRushClient(
  "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  {},
  {
    onConnecting: () => console.log("Connecting to streaming service..."),
    onOpened: () => console.log("Connected to streaming service!"),
    onClosed: () => console.log("Disconnected from streaming service"),
    onError: (error) => console.error("Streaming error:", error),
  }
);

// Subscribe to OHLCV data for trading pairs
const unsubscribePairs = client.StreamingService.subscribeToOHLCVPairs(
  {
    chain_name: StreamingChain.BASE_MAINNET,
    pair_addresses: ["0x9c087Eb773291e50CF6c6a90ef0F4500e349B903"],
    interval: StreamingInterval.ONE_MINUTE,
    timeframe: StreamingTimeframe.ONE_HOUR,
  },
  {
    next: (data) => {
      console.log("Received OHLCV pair data:", data);
    },
    error: (error) => {
      console.error("Streaming error:", error);
    },
    complete: () => {
      console.log("Stream completed");
    },
  }
);

// Unsubscribe when done
// unsubscribePairs();

// Disconnect from streaming service when finished
// await client.StreamingService.disconnect();
```

#### Multiple Subscriptions

The SDK uses a singleton WebSocket client internally, allowing you to create multiple subscriptions through the same `GoldRushClient`.

```ts
// Create a single client
const client = new GoldRushClient("<YOUR_API_KEY>");

// Create multiple subscriptions through the same connection
const unsubscribePairs = client.StreamingService.subscribeToOHLCVPairs(
  {
    chain_name: StreamingChain.BASE_MAINNET,
    pair_addresses: ["0x9c087Eb773291e50CF6c6a90ef0F4500e349B903"],
    interval: StreamingInterval.ONE_MINUTE,
    timeframe: StreamingTimeframe.ONE_HOUR,
  },
  {
    next: (data) => console.log("OHLCV Pairs:", data),
  }
);

const unsubscribeTokens = client.StreamingService.subscribeToOHLCVTokens(
  {
    chain_name: StreamingChain.BASE_MAINNET,
    token_addresses: ["0x4B6104755AfB5Da4581B81C552DA3A25608c73B8"],
    interval: StreamingInterval.ONE_MINUTE,
    timeframe: StreamingTimeframe.ONE_HOUR,
  },
  {
    next: (data) => console.log("OHLCV Tokens:", data),
  }
);

const unsubscribeWallet = client.StreamingService.subscribeToWalletActivity(
  {
    chain_name: StreamingChain.BASE_MAINNET,
    wallet_addresses: ["0xbaed383ede0e5d9d72430661f3285daa77e9439f"],
  },
  {
    next: (data) => console.log("Wallet Activity:", data),
  }
);

// Unsubscribe from individual streams when needed
// unsubscribePairs();
// unsubscribeTokens();
// unsubscribeWallet();

// Or disconnect from all streams at once
// await client.StreamingService.disconnect();
```

#### React Integration

For React applications, use the `useEffect` hook to properly manage subscription lifecycle:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = client.StreamingService.rawQuery(
    `subscription {
        ohlcvCandlesForPair(
          chain_name: BASE_MAINNET
          pair_addresses: ["0x9c087Eb773291e50CF6c6a90ef0F4500e349B903"],
          interval: StreamingInterval.ONE_MINUTE,
          timeframe: StreamingTimeframe.ONE_HOUR,
        ) {
          open
          high
          low
          close
          volume
          price_usd
          volume_usd
          chain_name
          pair_address
          interval
          timeframe
          timestamp
        }
      }`,
    {},
    {
      next: (data) => console.log("Received streaming data:", data),
      error: (err) => console.error("Subscription error:", err),
      complete: () => console.info("Subscription completed"),
    }
  );

  // Cleanup function - unsubscribe when component unmounts
  return () => {
    unsubscribe();
  };
}, []);
```

#### Raw Queries

You can also use raw GraphQL queries for more streamlined and selective data scenarios:

```ts
const unsubscribeNewPairs = client.StreamingService.rawQuery(
  `subscription {
       newPairs(
         chain_name: BASE_MAINNET,
         protocols: [UNISWAP_V2, UNISWAP_V3]
       ) {
         chain_name
         protocol
         pair_address
         tx_hash
         liquidity
         base_token_metadata {
           contract_name
           contract_ticker_symbol
         }
         quote_token_metadata {
           contract_name
           contract_ticker_symbol
         }
       }
     }`,
  {},
  {
    next: (data) => console.log("Raw new pairs data:", data),
    error: (error) => console.error("Error:", error),
  }
);

// Raw query for token OHLCV data
const unsubscribeTokenOHLCV = client.StreamingService.rawQuery(
  `subscription {
      ohlcvCandlesForToken(
        chain_name: BASE_MAINNET
        token_addresses: ["0x4B6104755AfB5Da4581B81C552DA3A25608c73B8"]
        interval: ONE_MINUTE
        timeframe: ONE_HOUR
      ) {
        open
        high
        low
        close
        volume
        volume_usd
        quote_rate
        quote_rate_usd
        timestamp
        base_token {
          contract_name
          contract_ticker_symbol
        }
      }
    }`,
  {},
  {
    next: (data) => console.log("Raw token OHLCV data:", data),
    error: (error) => console.error("Error:", error),
  }
);
```

### 9. Standardized (Error) Responses
